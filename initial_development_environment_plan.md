# Initial Development Environment Setup Plan

## 1. Technology Stack Selection
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python for AI components.
  - Prolog for logical reasoning.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: 
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural networks.
  - Flask or FastAPI for web services.

## 2. Development Tools Configuration
- **IDEs**: 
  - Set up VSCode or PyCharm as the primary development environment.
- **Extensions**: 
  - Install extensions for Python, Prolog, and Git integration.
  - Enable code linting and formatting tools.

## 3. Version Control Setup
- **Git Repository**: 
  - Initialize a Git repository in the project directory.
- **Branching Strategy**: 
  - Define a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, develop branch).
- **Commit Message Conventions**: 
  - Establish guidelines for writing clear and concise commit messages.

## 4. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI/CD Tools**: 
  - Set up GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI for automated workflows.
- **Automated Testing**: 
  - Define testing frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python).
- **Deployment Processes**: 
  - Create scripts for deploying the application to production.

## 5. Documentation and Knowledge Base
- **Central Repository**: 
  - Create a documentation folder in the project directory.
- **Setup Instructions**: 
  - Document the setup process for new developers.
- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Define coding standards and best practices.

## 6. Environment Configuration
- **Virtual Environments**: 
  - Use `venv` or `conda` to create isolated environments for Python projects.
- **Configuration Files**: 
  - Create `.env` files for environment-specific settings.

## 7. Initial Project Timeline
- **Milestones**: 
  - Define key milestones for the initial setup and development phases.
- **Deadlines**: 
  - Set deadlines for each milestone to ensure timely progress.

## Conclusion
- This plan outlines the necessary steps to set up the initial development environment for the multi-agent system project. Following this plan will ensure a smooth development process and facilitate collaboration among team members.
